**Description**

The QR Code Generator project enables users to enter a URL or text and generate a corresponding QR code. The application utilizes the [qrserver.com](https://goqr.me/api/) API to generate the QR code image based on the user's input. Once the QR code is generated, it is displayed in the application, allowing users to save or share it as needed.
